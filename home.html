    <h1>Part-Time Vagabond</h1>
    <p>Greetings fellow traveler and welcome to Scott’s <em id="emphasis">Part-Time Vagabond</em> blog. I have wanted to make a proper landing place to tell the stories of my adventures for a long time.  Also, I’m learning to code and this blog is my first project.  So, whether you are a coding colleague, an adventure enthusiast, or my mom who will inevitably be one of my first readers, welcome.
